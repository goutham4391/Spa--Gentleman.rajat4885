<h3>Fade</h3><p>The fade haircut has been one of the most popular men’s haircuts for generations, and that will continue for the foreseeable future. While there are many types of fade haircuts, the general idea is always the same: fades involve cutting hair so that it becomes increasingly shorter down the sides, around the ear and nape of the neck. The best fade haircuts work well for virtually every hair type, including straight, curly, wavy, thick, or thin. </p><p>There are high, low and mid fades which determine where the tapering starts. A high fade starts at the top of the sides of your head while a low fade starts immediately above the ears, and a mid fade starts in between. High fades tend to be bolder while low fades subtler, and if you really want to make a statement, you can go with a skin fade. The bald fade buzzes hair down to the skin for a very short cut.</p><h3>Undercut</h3><p>While an undercut is like a fade in that the hair on the sides is shorter than the hair on top, there is one noticeable difference: the length. Whereas a fade involves gradually shorter hair toward the ears and the nape, an undercut is the same length all the way around.</p><p>It is by and large one of the most popular cuts among hipsters and young men who want to style a slicked back undercut. The undercut works best for men who have thick straight hair, but it can be incorporated into wavy and curly hairstyles for a trendy look.</p><p>The disconnected undercut, which is the boldest variation of this cut, requires very short hair along the sides to create a high contrast look. Try growing a thick beard with your cool undercut for a very masculine, alpha-male look.</p><h3>Comb Over</h3><p>The comb over was once negatively attributed to balding men who combed their hair over from one side to the other to hide a severely receding hairline or thin hair. However, in recent years, the comb over fade has become one of the hottest hairstyles for guys.</p><p>In fact, the comb over is an iconic style that more and more men have fallen in love with – and for good reason. It provides a number of styling options and works well with virtually any hair type and texture. </p><p>Nowadays, a comb over is the description given to a haircut that involves at least 2 to 3 inches of hair all combed to one side. For an edgy finish, guys can ask their barbers to add a hard part.</p><p>Of all the haircut styles trending for 2019, the comb over fade haircut is one of the most recognizable and timeless. The medium-length hair on top is perfect for styling a pompadour, slick back, quiff, or even spikes, if you decide you want to change up your look in the middle of the week.</p><h3>Quiff</h3><p>The modern quiff provides the perfect balance between classic styles and stylish new trends. There are several different types of quiff hairstyles, but most men opt for the textured look that looks relaxed and casual. While styling a quiff does require good hair product and time, this cool hairstyle is well worth the effort and trouble. </p><p>A quiff requires at least 3 inches of hair on top to create, and should be paired with an undercut or fade for a dapper look. Wax will give you lift and hold without the shine, which makes your style look more natural; a pomade takes things to the next level and gives you a more professional, formal, or refined look with a hint of shine.</p><h3>Slicked Back Hair</h3><p>Slicked back hair was once the prevalent bad-boy greaser hairstyle. Though it’s true that this style gained its notoriety back in the 1950s, the slick back is still one of the most popular haircuts for men, according <a href="https://www.menshairstylesnow.com/cool-hairstyles/">MensHairstylesNow.com</a>. </p><p>Though the haircut comes in many styles, it is characterized by brushing your hair straight back and away from your face. Many men prefer medium-length hair from the top to the sides slicked back with a high-hold, high-shine pomade, but others pair their slicked back cuts with a chic undercut or even a high skin fade for a more aggressive look. In this case, they may opt for matte hair styling products. </p><p>More men than ever before choose the slicked back haircut because it’s so very easy to style and works well in numerous situations. You can go from day to night in a flash by using hair wax in the morning for a natural, effortless look and a high-shine pomade in the evening for a badass finish.</p><h3>Faux Hawk</h3><p>The full mohawk is most commonly seen among the punk crowd, and while many men enjoy the look, it’s a bit too loud for their everyday lives. Thanks to the introduction of the faux hawk (sometimes called fohawk), it has been transformed from the huge, tall spikes associated with the mohawk haircut to something much subtler.</p><p>Believe it or not, the faux hawk is versatile enough to be your everyday style. The faux hawk fade has been trending strong in recent years and will continue to be a hotly requested <a href="https://gentlemansbarberspa.com/services/">cut in barbershops</a> around the world.</p><p>To get a faux hawk, you will need at least 2 to 3 inches of length on the top paired with short sides. Guys can go with a narrow or wide strip of longer hair on top. Longer spiked hair may stand out in crowds, but short spiky hair is a better choice for business professionals.</p><p>On off days, guys can even style a brushed up hairstyle or add a fringe. Nevertheless, one thing is for certain – you will need a good high-hold product to create and maintain your style.</p><h2>Best Men’s Hairstyles</h2><p>With so many types of cool men’s hairstyles, guys have several choices. From the comb over and side part to spiky hair and faux hawk, there are excellent haircuts for men with short, medium or long hair.

<p>&nbsp;Biotin is a B-Complex vitamin that plays an important part in growing and repairing cells in your body.</p><p>It is also major factor in the synthesis of fatty acids and vital for amino acids.</p><p>It is a common vitamin supplement for maintaining a healthy metabolism, and also for men experiencing thinning hair or hair loss.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p>


<hr />

<p><strong>Here are some more benefits of using <a href="https://gentlemansbarberspa.com/our-hair-products">Gentleman's™</a> Biotin &amp; Vitamin Shampoo and Conditioner that you may not know about:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Consistent use of biotin repairs split ends and eliminates breakage, both of which make your hair look better and healthier.&nbsp;</li><li>Using a shampoo with biotin will help when hair follicles are blocked by flakes. Follicles blocked by dead skin inhibit natural, normal hair growth. Our biotin shampoo clears the flakes and allows the hair to grow as it should.</li><li>The other natural ingredients in our biotin shampoo and conditioner will nourish your hair follicles, which encourages absorption of the biotin into your scalp.</li><li>You may see an increase in the speed or volume of hair growth. Especially if you're going for longer hair or guys with thin hair -&nbsp;as hair that is not breaking tends to grow more quickly.</li><li>If you have been using commercial shampoos or shampoos with harsh chemicals, the biotin shampoo will repair the damage done to your hair.&nbsp;</li><li>if you have dry hair, it will stimulate the production of sebum, a natural moisturizer found in the scalp. The result is less breakage and nicer looking hair.&nbsp;</li></ol>

<p>If you have a beard, you already know: just like the hair on your head, your facial hair needs a certain amount of care to maintain the kind of look and feel you want.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a good idea to use Gentleman's beard oil from the beginning of your beard-growing process, in order to keep your face from getting dry, irritated or itchy. But it's always better late than never when it comes to beard care. So if you have a beard, it may be time to start with Gentleman's beard oil to infuse the correct moisture balance into the individual follicles.&nbsp;</p><p>Our beard oil is paraben, preservative and toxin free. Peter Palushi, founder of Gentleman's Barber Spa and the man behind the new Gentleman's products, believes in the highest quality products for his clients:&nbsp;</p>

Some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nba.com/knicks/">New York Knicks</a>&nbsp;and NYC FC players and coaches have become loyal clients.

<h3>Marshall Plumlee, recent New York Knicks signee, stopped by for a fresh cut last month. Undrafted, he took a different path to the NBA than his two NBA-veteran brothers, Miles and Mason. He told the NY Daily News he looks forward to "getting his hands dirty" this year. We're hoping he makes the roster - he could add toughness to the defense with his 7-ft frame!&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>MLS players for NYCFC, Frederic Brilliant and Shannon Gomez, came in to enjoy a cut and shave at Gentleman's Barber Spa. Frederic Brilliant<span>, a solid soccer veteran, is a 30-year old French center back. He has made 79 appearances for the Belgian first division side over the past three seasons. Prior to that Brillant amassed 185 total appearances in Belgian professional football since 2005.</span></h3><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shannon Gomez is a <span>quick youngster capable of playing as a right back or on the wing.&nbsp;Gomez joined NYCFC for their final preseason camp of 2016 and impressed enough to earn a contract. The Trinidad and Tobago international is an intriguing prospect for the future.</span></h3>

<h3>Gentleman's Barber Spa founder, Peter Palushi, was interviewed for a recent Westchester Magazine article about current men's hairstyles. Peter was quoted several times for his knowledge of men's hairstyle and grooming trends, and the article contains several photos of haircuts at our barbershop!&nbsp;</h3><h3>Thanks to Westchester Magazine for coming to us about Men's Style. Check out the link, or read the full article text below:</h3><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Wellness/March-2016/The-Most-Popular-Mens-Hairstyles-in-Westchester/">http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Wellness/March-2016/The-Most-Popular-Mens-Hairstyles-in-Westchester/</a></p><p> </p><h1>The Most Popular Men’s Hairstyles In Westchester</h1><h3>Local stylists tell us the cuts guys are asking for.</h3><p>BY CARLOS VILLAMAYOR</p><p>If you’re like a lot of men, you may be wearing the same hairstyle you were wearing a decade ago. It’s easy, after all, and it looks fine—so why fix what isn’t broken? The thing is, your hair says as much about your style, if not more, than your choice of shirts, ties, and shoes. So what better time to spruce up your look than spring? We asked some Westchester salons for the most popular men’s hairstyles this season, and received the following 13 trending styles for men. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>Man Bun</strong></p><p>Lindsey Jennex, master stylist at <a href="http://www.thebeautyboxny.com/">The Beauty Box</a>&nbsp;in Rye, says the man bun has become very popular in the last couple of years.</p><p>“Some are cleaner than others in the sense that the man bun can look more professional and finished, while others have a more ‘surfer’ or bohemian. This tends to be a large growing trend among men in 20s or in the hipster crowd,” Jennex says. “This look requires very little maintenance. Most likely, there was little to no product used in this photo. If any product is used, I would say maybe a gel similar to Bumble and bumble Gel.”</p><p><strong>London Look</strong></p><p>“For spring, short on the sides with length on top is very clever and also easy to manage for different occasions,” says Flavio Oliveira, owner of <a href="http://www.modeasalon.com/">Mode A Salon</a>&nbsp;in Bronxville.</p><p>“During the day and at work, those who like a wet look on the sides can use gel, or wear your hair dry and comb it all the way to the back, creating a serious look for the office. At night or for the weekend, simply spike it up,” he advises.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Grunge Rocker</strong></p><p>“This is the new look for your lived-in haircuts. Let your barber or stylist give a cut that looks like it’s a few weeks old,” says Michele Lisa Milazzo, owner of <a href="http://www.michelelisasalon.com/">Michele Lisa Salon</a>&nbsp;in Cortlandt Manor.</p><p> </p><p>Blended Taper</p><p><strong>Blended Taper Cut</strong></p><p>This style starts from zero at the bottom and is blended into a long top.</p><p>“The top is very flexible,” says Peter Palushi, owner of the <a href="http://www.gentlemansbarberspa.com/">Gentleman’s Barber Spa</a>&nbsp;in White Plains. “It can be styled straight back, pompadour, or to the side”</p><p> </p><p><strong>High Fade Pompadour</strong></p><p>“This is a look where the sides are typically faded from shortest at the hairline, gradually getting longer toward the top, and the hair on top is left long and usually slicked back,” Jennex says.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Side Part Coif</strong></p><p>“A high fade meets undercut with a true off-to-the-side Coif,” says Milazzo.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Scruff</strong></p><p>“This look is super <em>in</em>&nbsp;right now with men. It is easy to maintain and very versatile as well,” says Oliveira. “To style it, you can use pomade, and I recommend Original Pomade by Oribe. It helps to create an uncomplicated style without making your hair heavy, and also contains UV protection.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Taper Back with Classic Side Part</strong></p><p>“I find that men are going more for the shorter cuts than keeping their hair long,” Palushi says.</p>

<p><strong>Hard Part and High Fade</strong></p><p>This style features faded sides with length on top, “but it also shows a very hard part in the hair,” says Jennex. “This is a retro look that most men in the 1950s wore. It created a very polished and professional look.”&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Classic</strong></p><p>“Short everywhere; men love it and always ask for it. Doesn’t change and keeps it simple. Sometimes, less is more,” says Oliveira. “For those who like short hair, it’s best to have a haircut every four weeks to maintain it, and use a good shampoo to help the hair grow healthy and shiny. My recommendation is Signature Shampoo from Oribe, a daily shampoo with UV protection.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gentleman's Barber Spa creator, Peter Palushi, spent Sunday, January 24th -&nbsp;Tuesday, January 26th at the Javits Center in NYC for MRket.&nbsp;He was asked by former employer and royal barber, Truefitt &amp; Hill of London, to perform the Royal Shave for MRket Show attendees.</p><p>One of the gentleman Peter came across during his work at MRket was former Knicks shooting guard, John Starks. There's just something about a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gentlemansbarberspa.com/about-us/">classic barber shop</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gentlemansbarberspa.com/services/">a relaxing shave, a trim </a>and a place to kick back. That's why guys like John Starks, actor Sean Bean and many other public figures like Gentleman's Barber Spa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Peter is thrilled that Gentleman's Barber Spa will soon offer Truefitt &amp; Hill products. Located in London, they are the oldest barb shop in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Truefitt &amp; Hill originally served as the primary barbers for the British Royal Family. Their men's hair, shaving and skincare products are legendary, of the highest quality and hard to find elsewhere. Look for them soon!&nbsp;</p>
